# Week 5 - Progress Report

## Progress in the Previous Week

- Implement the communication using socket and Stream
- Testing sampling methods
- Implement sorting and partitioning

For the final merge, can we sort directly the merge of all the partitions in input folder of a worker? Can we make the assumption it fits in RAM?
-> Data may not fit in RAM. For example, your program should be able to sort 100GB of input data on an 8GB-memory machine.
